## Inheritance

```java
public abstract class Parent {
  // Can't create instance of Parent
}

public class Child extends Parent {
  // Can create instance of Child
  // Child inherits any methods and properties in Parent
}

public interface xyz {
  void abc() throws IOException;
}

public interface pqr {
  void abc() throws FileNotFoundException;
}

public class Main implements xyz, pqr {
  // The last interface takes a higher precedence
  public void abc() throws FileNotFoundException;
}
```

## Polymorphism

- The ability of an object to take on many forms
- Any object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic

```java
public interface Vegetarian {}
public class Animal {}

// Polymorphic since a Deer IS-A Animal, IS-A Vegetarian, IS-A Deer, IS-A Object
public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian {}
```

## Access Modifiers


| Modifier  | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass | Everyone |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| public    | X          | X            | X        | X        |
| protected | X          | X            | X        |          |
| default   | X          | X            |          |          |
| private   | X          |              |          |          |

## Law Of Demeter

- Also known as *The Principle of Least Knowledge*
- Rules:
  1. A method `M` in an object `O` can call on any other method within `O` itself
  2. A method `M` in an object `O` can call on any methods of parameters passed to the method `M`
  3. A method `M` can call a method `N` of another object, if that object is instantiated within the method `M`
  4. Any method `M` in an object `O` can call on any methods of any type of object that is a direct component of `O`

```java
public class O {

  private E myE = new E();

  public void method M(E paramE) {
    // Rule 1
    this.W();

    // Rule 2
    paramE.N();

    // Rule 3
    E localE = new E();
    localE.N();

    // Rule 4
    this.myE.N();
  }

  private void method W() {}
}

public class E {
  public void method N() {}
}
```

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

## Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

- Selects and adapts an algorithm at runtime
- Advantages
  - Uses composition over inheritance allowing for better decoupling between the strategy and class
- Disadvantages
  - Increases the number of classes in the system
  - Client must be aware of different strategies

### State Pattern

- Allows an object to change its behaviour when its internal state changes
- State of the object is encapsulated in different state objects

### Iterator Pattern

- Allows for traversal of items in a collection without revealing any internal data structures

### Template Method Pattern

- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses
- Lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm, without changing the algorithms structure

### Composite Pattern

- Allows for composition of objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies

### Decorator Pattern

- Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically

```java
public interface Component {
  void doOperationA();
  void doOperationB();
}

public class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
  @Override
  void doOperationA();

  @Override
  void doOperationB();
}

public abstract class Decorator implements Component {
  private ConcreteComponent cc;
}

public class ConcreteDecoratorX extends Decorator {}
```

### Observer Pattern

- An object, called the **subject**, maintains a list of its dependents, called **observers**, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods

```java
public interface Observer {
  void update();
}

public class Observable {
  private ArrayList<Observer> observers;
  void addObserver(Observer o);
  void removeObserver(Observer o);
  void notifyObservers():
}

public class Display implements Observer {
  @Override
  void update();
}
```

### Factory Method Pattern

- Allows creation of objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created

```java
public interface Product {}

public abstract class Creator {
  abstract public Product makeProduct();
}

public class ConcreteCreator extends Creator {
  @Override
  public Product makeProduct();
}
```

### Builder Pattern

- Enables encapsulation of the construction of a product and allows the object to be constructed in steps

```java
public class User {
  private final String name;
  private final String phone;
  // ...

  private User(UserBuilder ub) {
    this.name = ub.name;
    this.phone = ub.phone;
    // ...
  }

  public static class UserBuilder {
    private final String name;
    private final String phone;
    // ...

    public UserBuilder(String name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    public UserBuilder phone(String phone) {
      this.phone = phone;
      return this;
    }

    public User build() {
      return new User(this);
    }
}

// In use
User user = new User.UserBuilder("Bob")
  .phone("1234")
  .build();
```

### Singleton Pattern

- Ensuring a class only has one instance throughout the lifetime of the program

```java
public final class Singleton {
  private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

  private Singleton() {}

  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return instance;
  }
}
```

### Command Pattern

- An object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time
- Has 4 key components: the **command** object, the **receiver**, the **invoker** and a **client**

```java
public interface Command {
  void execute();
}

// Invoker
public class Switch {
  private ArrayList<Command> history;

  public void storeAndExecute(Command cmd);
}

// Receiver
public class Light {
  public void turnOn();
  public void turnOff();
}

// Command object
public class FlipUpCommand implements Command {
  @Override
  public void execute();
}
```

### Visitor Pattern

- Need a pattern where one class/interface (Visitor) defines a computation/operation and another (Visitable) is responsible for providing data access
- Need a way to add new behaviour to a family of classes without modifying the existing classes

## Principles

### Open Closed Principle

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Single Responsibility Principle

- A class should only have one reason to change
- High cohesion

### Dependency Injection Principle

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions

## Design By Contract

- A class that provides a service and its caller should have a formal contract
- The contract is enforced between the service- provider and caller through **pre**-conditions, **post**- conditions and class **invariants**

```java
/**
 * @invariant balance >= 0
 */
public class Account {

  /**
   * Deposit into an account
   * @pre amount > 0
   * @post balance = balance + amount
   */
  public void deposit(float amount);
}
```

## Test Driven Development

1. Write a test that fails
2. Implement the code to pass the test
3. Refactor and eliminate redundancy, goto 1

## Generics

- Compile time checking

```java
public class Bag<T> {
  private T t;
  public T get();
  public void set(T t);
}
```

## Threads

- A thread is a single sequence of execution within a process
- Multi-threading refers to multiple threads of control within a single process

```java
public class Counter implements Runnable {
  private int count = 0;

  @Override
  public void run() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
      System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + counter++);
  }
}

// Usage
Runnable c = new Counter();
Thread t1 = new Thread(c);
Thread t2 = new Thread(c);
t1.start();
t2.start();
```

## Concurrency

- A **race condition** may occur inside a critical section
- A **critical section** is a section of code that is executed by multiple threads, and where the sequence of execution of the threads makes a difference in the result of the concurrent execution of the critical section
- **Deadlock** arises when locking a thread results in a situation where other threads cannot proceed and thus wait forever for other thread(s) to terminate
- **Starvation** arises when threads have different priorities, and the thread scheduler gives a lock to the highest priority threads such that the lower priority threads never get access to the shared resource

```java
public class Counter implements Runnable {
  private int count = 0;

  // Using synchronized to lock critical sections
  public void add(int value) {
    synchronized(this) {
      count += value;
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void run() {}
}
```

## Code Smells

- **Bloaters**
  - Long method
  - Large class
  - Long parameter list
  - Data clumps
- **OO Abusers**
  - Switch statements
- **Change Preventers**
  - Divergent change
  - Shotgun surgery
- **Dispensables**
  - Comments
  - Data class
  - Lazy class
  - Duplicate code
- **Couplers**
  - Feature envy
  - Message chains

## Refactoring Techniques

- Move field/method
- Extract class/inline class
- Extract method
- Introduce parameter object
- Replace local variable with method
- Replace with polymorphism
