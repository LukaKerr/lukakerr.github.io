## Week 1

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. Analysis & Specification
   - Understanding the problem
   - Gather requirements
   - Use case modelling, user stories
2. Design
   - Domain modelling
   - Design artifcats
3. Implementation
   - Programming the solution
4. Testing
   - Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests
5. Release & Maintenance
   - Releasing the software
   - Fixing defects, adding new functionality

## Week 2

### Requirements

A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective

- Functional Requirements
  - Defines the specific functionality that the software system is expected to accomplish
  - What inputs the system should accept and under what conditions
  - The behaviour of the system
  - What outputs the system must produce and under what conditions
  - For example: the system must let a user login and make a booking
- Non-Functional Requirements
  - Describe the quality attributes of the software system
  - For example: the system must process all events quickly

### Use Cases

- A step-by-step description of how a user will use the system-to-be to accomplish business goals
- A single use case includes:
  - Name/number
  - Related requirements
  - Initiating actors
  - Actor goal
  - Participating actors
  - Preconditions
  - Postconditions
  - Flow of events

**Use Case Diagram**

A use case diagram portrays how actors interact with various parts of the system.

Includes:

- A system boundary - all actors are outside, and all use cases are inside
- Actors with names (i.e. staff, customer)
- Interaction with use cases:
  - `<<initiate>>` for actors who intiate the use case
  - `<<participate>>` for actors who are part of the use case but don't initiate it
  - `<<include>>` for use cases that require another use case (e.g. the use case "Unlock" `<<includes>>` the use case "Authenticate User")
  - `<<extend>>` for use cases that are optional when performing a seperate use case (e.g. the use case "Remove Item" `<<extends>>` the use case "View Cart")


## Week 3

### Domain Model

- A domain model provides a visual representation of the problem domain, through decomposing the domain into key concepts or objects in the real-world and identifying the relationships between these objects.
- A domain model is also known as a conceptual model or domain object model.
- It is represented using a class diagram
- It includes:
  - Classes/Objects
  - Attributes
  - Methods
  - Relationships (has one, has many)
  - Cardinality
  - Inheritance

### OO Principles

**Abstraction**

- Incorporates the common properties of objects
- Any classes inheriting from an abstract class must implement the methods/properties of that abstract class

**Encapsulation**

- Hiding the objects state (attributes)
- Use of methods to provide access to the object (getters, setters)
- Importance:
  - Ensures that an objects state is consistent
  - Increases usability
  - Abstracts the implementation

**Inheritance**

- Models a relationship between classes in which one class represents a more general concept (parent or base class) and another a more specialised class (sub-class)

**Association**

- Aggregation
  - The contained item is an element of a collection, but can also exist on its own if the collection is destroyed
  - For example: A student at a university - the student can exist if the university is destroyed
  - Uses a non-filled in diamond ◇
- Composition
  - The contained item is an integral part of the collection
  - For example: pages in a book - if the book is destroyed, so are the pages
  - Uses a filled in diamond ◆

### CRC Cards

- CRC stands for:
  - Class: represents a collection of similar objects
  - Responsibility: Something the class knows or does
  - Collaborator: Another class that a class must interact with to fulfil its responsibilities
- Used to represent a domain object
- Can be transformed into UML class diagrams where:
  - Classes → Concepts
  - Responsibilities → Aggregation/Composition
  - Collaborations → Relationships


## Week 5

### Software Development Methodologies

**Waterfall Model**

- Linear, sequential
  - Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment and Maintenance
- Each phase must be completed, documented and signed off before the next one is started
- Simple to understand due to project visibility
- Suitable for risk-free projects with stable product statements and clear requirements
- Disadvantages:
  - No working software until late into the process
  - Rigid and not flexible, no support for fine tuning of requirements throughout the cycle
  - Heavy documentation requirements

**Rational Unified Process (RUP)**

- An iterative software development approach
- Consists of four phases:
  - *Inception*: scope the project, identify what resources are required, architecture and risks, estimate costs
  - *Elaboration*: understand the problem domain, analysis, evaluate in detail required architecture and resources
  - *Construction*: design, build and test software
  - *Transition*: release software to production
- Development is organised into disciplines:
  - Development disciplines
    - Business modelling and requirements
    - Understanding domain, develop high-level requirements, model and document vision and requirements
  - Support disciplines
    - Configuration and change management, project management, environment
- Serial in the large (sequential phases), but iterative in small (work across all disciplines in each iteration)

### Agile

Advantages:

- Working software gets produced much faster
- Requirements can change to the clients needs over time
- The client is engaged more through each iteration and provides feedback
- Focused on business value

Disadvantages:

- Remote teams face difficulties with daily standups
- Incremental devlopment/adaptability not suited to clients desiring contracts with firm estimates
- Reliance on small self-organized teams makes it difficult to adapt to large software projects
- Lack of comprehensive documentation can make it difficult to maintain or add to the software
- Need highly experienced software engineers who know how to both work independently and interface effectively with business users

**Extreme Programming (XP)**

- Focuses on providing the highest value to the customer ASAP
- Changes to requirements are allowed
- Adaptability over predictability
- Principles: pair programming, continuous integration, open workspace, refactoring, test driven development
- Continuous feedback is a big part of XP, coming from other developers and customers
- Steps in XP:
  - Initial exploration
    - Developers and customers discuss the system, break down features into user stories
    - Estimations for user stories
  - Release plan
    - Customers prioritise user stories and negotiate a release date
  - Iteration planning
    - Use the release plan to create iteration plans
    - An iteration size is chosen (1-2 weeks) and user stories are completed in priority
    - Once begun, customers can't change the user stories
    - Iteration ends on the specified date even if the user stories aren't done
  - Task planing
    - Developers and customers arrange an iteration planning meeting at the beginning of each iteration
    - Customers choose user stories for the iteration
    - User stories are broken down into programming tasks
    - Developers choose user stories and provide estimates


## Week 6

### User Stories

A user story must contain 3 main parts: a **role**, **goal** and **benefit**. For example:

> **As a** customer **I want** to create an account **so that** I can shop online

To create a good user story, follow the INVEST acronym:

- Independent
  - Self contained
- Negotiable
  - Leave room for negotiation, only complete what is required from the user story
- Valuable
  - The user story must have value to the customer/business
- Estimable
  - Each user story must be clear enough to estimate
- Small
  - Each user story should be small and only contain one main goal
- Testable
  - Each user story should have an *acceptance criteria* that when fulfilled, signifies the user story is completed

### Epic Stories

Epic story are short overarching goals that encapsulate multiple smaller user
stories.

### UML Diagrams

There are 2 broad categories of UML diagrams:

- Structure diagrams
  - Show the static structure of a system and its parts
  - Elements are depicted irrespetive of time and no interations between elements are modelled
  - Examples include: class diagram, deployment diagram
- Behaviour diagrams
  - Shows the dynamic behaviour of objects in the system
  - Examples include: use case diagram, sequence diagram

**Sequence Diagram**

- Provides a visual summary of a use-case scenario
- Shows for a particular use case scenario the events the external actors generate, their order and possible inter-system events
- Essentially, given a use case, show what methods are called and data returned for each step in the method
- Shows:
  - External actors
  - Messages (methods) invoked by actors
  - Return values (if any) associated with messages
  - Indication of any loops or iteration area

**Activity Diagram**

- Visualise the workflow of a use case
- More detailed tracing of the method for different possible paths, or concurrent threads


## Week 7/8

### Effective Software Design

**Design Smells**

- A symptom of poor design
- Often caused by violation of key design principles
- Has structures in software that suggests refactoring
- Rigidity
  - When the software is too large to be changed, even in simple ways
- Fragility
  - Tendency of the software to break in many places when a single change is made
- Immobility
  - Design is hard to reuse and has parts that could be useful to reuse, but the effort in moving them is too high
- Viscosity
  - When changes in the software are easier to implement through 'hacks', and when the development environment is slow and inefficient
- Opacity
  - Tendency of a piece of software to be difficult to understand
- Needless complexity
  - Code is ahead of the requirements and contains constructs that are not currently useful
- Needless repetition
  - Software contains repeaded code that could be reused under a single abstraction

**Refactoring**

- The process of restructuring the internals of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify, without changing its external, observable behaviour

**Characteristics of Good Design**

Good software design aims to have **loose coupling** and **high cohesion**, so the software is extensible, reusable, maintainable, understandable and testable.

- Coupling
  - The degree of interdependence between components/classes
  - **Tight coupling** occurs when two components are highly dependent on each other, and any changes made affects the other component largely
- Cohesion
  - The degree to which all elements of a component or class work together as a functional unit
  - **Low cohesion** occurs when a single class performs many functions, that are not necessarily relative to that specific class

### SOLID Principles

- **SRP** - Single Responsibility Principle
  - *A class should have one reason to change*
  - A class only performs one main responsibility
  - Advantages include: readability, reusability, testability, high cohesion
- **OCP** - Open Closed Principle
  - *Software entities should be open for extension and closed for modification*
  - As requirements change, modules can be extended with new behaviours, but the internals of the module should not be changed
  - Using abstract classes
  - Advantages include: reduced rigidity, flexibility, reusability, maintainability
- **LSP** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **ISP** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **DIP** - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - *High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Rather, both should depend upon abstractions*
  - Advantages include: loose coupling, reusability, testability, maintainability


## Week 9

### Testing

**Types**:

- Black box testing
  - Tests a program with sets of input without looking at how the program is implemented
- White box testing
  - Tests a program with test data and knowledge of how the program is implemented
- Regression testing
  - Verifying software that was changed, still performs correctly

**Test Coverage**:

Measures the degree to which software has been exercised by tests

**Code Coverage**:

Measures the degree to which the source code of a program has been tested

**Test Driven Development**:

- Writing tests that fail then implementing the code to make the tests pass

**Equivalence Testing**:

- Divides the space of all possible inputs into equivalence groups such that the program behaves the same on each group
- Two steps:
  - Partitioning the values of input parameters into equivelance groups
  - Choosing the test input values

**Boundary Testing**:

- A special case of equivalence testing that focuses on the boundary values of input parameters
- Based on the assumption that developers often overlook edge cases
- One step: select elements from the 'edges' of the equivalence class (e.g. NULL, empty, min, max)


### Errors in Python

**Exceptions**:

```python
# create a custom exception
class MyException(BaseException):
  def __init__(self, messages):
    self.messages = messages
```

```python
# raise an exception
raise MyException("a message")
```

```python
# catch an exception
try:
  # try to something that might raise an exception
except MyException:
  # executed when MyException is raised
finally:
  # always executed
else:
  # executed when there is no exception
```

**Asserts**:

```python
def func():
  x = 5
  assert x > 0
```

### Testing With PyTest

```python
import pytest

# check for exception being raised
with pytest.raises(BookingError) as info:
  call_function()
  assert info == "error message"
```


## Week 10

### Databases

**Database Design Steps**:

1. Analyse requirements, identify data and operations
2. Model data at a high, abstract level (OO/ER models)
3. Create a database schema
4. Implement the database by creating an instance of the schema
5. Build operations/interface such as stored procedures, SQL
6. Tune performance
7. Evolve and develop schema

**Aims of Data Modelling**:

- Describe the data stored
- Describe the relationships between data items
- Describe the constraints on data


## Week 11

### ER Diagrams

- Used for data modelling. Includes:
  - Entities (e.g. a real world thing/object)
  - Relationships (e.g. has, belongs to)
  - Attributes (e.g. fields)
  - Keys (e.g. primary/foreign/composite keys)
  - Cardinality (e.g. one to one, one to many, many to many)
  - Participation (e.g. total/partial participation)
  - Inheritance
- Weak entity set has no primary key of its own and only exists because of association with strong entities
- Subclasses and inheritance:
  - Subclasses can be overlapping (entity can be >= 0 subclasses) or disjoint (entity can only be 1 subclass)
  - Subclasses can be total (every entity must be >= 1 subclass) or partial (an entity may be a subclass)

### Relational Data Model

- Used for modelling tables and their relationships. Includes:
  - Table name
  - Attributes (are atomic - no composite/multi-values attributes. belong to a domain (name data type and format))

**Database Schema:**

- Used to model relationships between relational data models
- Uses arrows to show the relationship between table primary/foreign keys

### Mapping ER Diagram to Relational Data Model

The following ER concepts map to a relational data model:

- ER attribute → attribute (atomic)
- ER entity-instance/relationship-instance → tuple (row)
- ER entity-set/relationship → relation (table)
- ER key → primary key of relation


## Week 12

### Software Architecture

**An architecture style is defined by:**

- Components
  - A collection of computational units that 'do the work'. For example: classes, processes
- Connectors
  - Enable communication between components. For example: functions, events
- Constraints
  - Define how the components can be combined to form the system. For example: how data flows in regards to components/connectors

**Types of software architectures:**

- Client/Server
  - **Components**: server, client. **Connector**: request/response model.
  - 2-tiered, n-tiered or multi-tiered
  - Server provides a service, a client requests this service
  - For example: WWW, REST, SOAP, email server
- P2P
  - **Component**: peers. **Connector**: request/response model.
  - Each peer can function as both a server and a client
  - For example: bittorrent
- Pipe and Filter
  - **Component**: filter. **Connector**: pipe.
  - Output from one source is used as input to another
  - Can run concurrently if only parts of the input data is needed at one time
  - For example: compilers, unix pipes
- Central Repository
  - **Components**: a data repository and a data accessor. **Connectors**: read/write mechanism
  - For example: database, git
- Publish-Subscribe
  - **Components**: publisher components, subscriber components. **Connector**: notifications/events
  - For example: blogs, real time stock updates, wireless sensor networks
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
  - **Components**: servers. **Connector**: request/response, SOAP, REST, AJAX
  - Platform independent, loosely coupled software as a service
  - For example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), B2B services

  - **Entities** (classes)
  - **Attributes** (private and public) - attributes have a data type
  - **Methods** (private and public) - methods have a return data type

  - **Entities** - can be *strong* or *weak* (existance depends on a strong entity existing), is modelled after a real world object
  - **Relationships** - relates $\ge$ 2 entities, has *cardinality* (1-1, 1-n, n-n), has *participation* (total or partial)
  - **Attributes** - properties specific to an entity, can be *simple*, *composite* (made up of other attributes), *multi-valued* (have a set of values), *derived* (calculated at runtime from multiple attributes)
  - **Inheritance** - *overlapping* (can be multiple subclasses, or neither), *disjoint* (has to be only one subclass), *total* (has to be a subclass) or *partial* (can be parent class)


### ER Relational Model

- Displays a collection of relations between tables
- Has:
  - **Tables** (entities)
