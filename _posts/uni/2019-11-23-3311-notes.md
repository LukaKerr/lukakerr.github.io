## Introduction

**Data** is known recorded facts, with implicit meaning.
A **Database** is a collection of related data, satisfying constraints.
A **DBMS** is a database management system.

## Data Modelling

Data modelling is a design process that converts requirements into a data model.

The aims of data modelling are

- To describe what *information* is contained in the database
- To describe *relationships* between data items
- To describe *constraints* on data

There are two kinds of data models:

- Logical: abstract, for conceptual design (e.g. ER, ODL)
- Physical: record-based, for implementation (e.g. relational)

The most important aspects of a data model are correctness, completeness and consistency.

## ER Model

When modelling using the ER model we think of the world as a collection of inter-related entities.

The ER model has three main constructs

1. Attribute: data item describing a property of interest
2. Entity: collection of attributes describing object of interest
3. Relationship: association between entities

### ER Diagrams

ER diagrams are a graphical tool for data modelling.

An ER diagram consists of

- A collection of entity set definitions
- A collection of relationship set definitions
- Attributes associated with entity and relationship sets
- Connections between entity and relationship sets

#### Entities

An entity can be viewed as either a set of entities with the same set of attributes (extensional) or an abstract description of a class of entities (intensional).

Entities contain

- **Keys**: set of attributes whose set of values are distinct over entity set
- **Candidate Key**: a minimal key
- **Primary Key**: candidate key chosen by databse designer

![er-entity]({{ "/assets/img/3311/er-entity.svg" | absolute_url }})

#### Relationship Sets

A relationship is an association among several entities. A relationship set is a collection of relationships of the same type.

Relationships contain

- **Degree**: the number of entities involved in the relationship
- **Cardinality**: the number of associated entities on each side of the relationship
  - one-to-one (`[entity]<---(rel)--->[entity]`)
  - one-to-many (`[entity]<---(rel)----[entity]`)
  - many-to-many (`[entity]----(rel)----[entity]`)
- **Participation**: whether every entity must be in the relationship
  - partial (thin line)
  - total (thick line)
  
In some cases, a relationship needs associated attributes.

![er-relationship]({{ "/assets/img/3311/er-relationship.svg" | absolute_url }})

#### Weak Entities

Weak entities exist only because of association with strong entities. They have no key of their own and have a discriminator.

#### Subclasses & Inheritance

A subclass of an entity set $A$ is a set of entities with all attributes of $A$, plus (usually) it own attributes, that is involved in all of $A$'s relationships, plus its own.

Subclasses can be

- *overlapping* or *disjoint* (can an entity be in multiple subclasses?)
- *total* or *partial* (does every entity have to also be in a subclass?)

## Relational Model

The relational data model describes the world as a collection of inter-connected relations (or tables).

A relational data model consists of

- Relations
- Attributes
- Constraints

The value `NULL` belongs to all domains.

### Relations

Eeach relation has

- A name which is unique within a given database
- A set of attributes
- A unique key

### Attributes

Each attribute has 

- A name which is unique within a given database
- An associated domain or set of allowed values

### Constraints

Constraints are logical statements that describe what values are/are not allowed and what combinations of values are/are not allowed.

#### Integrity Constraints

Integrity constraints can

- Limit the set of values that attributes can take (*domain constraints*)
- Identify attributes that uniquely identify tuples (*key constraints*)
- Require keys to be fully-defined (*entity integrity constraints*)
- Require references to other tables to be valid (*referential integrity constraints*)

#### Referential Integrity

Referential integrity constraints can

- Describe references between relations
- Are related to notion of a foreign key

## Relational DBMSs

A _relational database management system_ (RDBMS)

- Is software designed to support large-scale data-intensive applications
- Allows high-level description of data with high-level access to the data
- Provides efficient storage and retrieval
- Supports multiple simultaneous users
- Does multiple simultaneous operations
- Maintains reliable access to the stored data

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a fully featured, client server DBMS. It is resource intensive and can run distributed and replicated.
It follows the SQL standard closely, but not totally. It also has extra datatypes (e.g. JSON)

### SQLite

SQLite is a fully featured, serverles DBMS. It is lightweight and intended to be embedded in applications.
It doesn't have stored procedures, but does have extra datatypes.

### Managing Databases

```bash
# Create a new, empty database
$ createdb dbname

# Drop and remove all data from a database
$ dropdb dbname

# Dump the contents of a database
$ pg_dump dbname > dumpfile

# Restore the contents of a database dump
$ psql dbname -f dumpfile
```

### SQL

SQL is a Data Definition Language that can formalise relational schemas.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableName (
  attrName1 domain1 constraints1,
  attrName2 domain2 constraints2,
  ...
  PRIMARY KEY (attri, attrj,...)
  FOREIGN KEY (attrx, attry,...) 
              REFERENCES
              OtherTable (attrm, attrn,...)
);
```

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Comments are after two dashes

-- Identifiers are alphanumeric and can be inside double quotes
-- Identifiers are case insensitive
"An Identifier", AnIdentifier

-- There are many keywords
CREATE, SELECT, TABLE, WHERE

-- Strings are inside single quotes
'a string'

-- Numbers are similar to C
1, -5, 3.14159

-- There are multiple types
integer, float, char(n), varchar(n), date

-- There are multiple operators
=, <>, <, <=, >, >=, AND, OR, NOT
```

#### Managing Tables

```sql
-- Create a table with attributes and constraints
CREATE TABLE table (Attributes + Constraints)

-- Modify a table
ALTER TABLE table TableSchemaChanges

-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE table(s) [ CASCADE ]

-- Truncate a table
TRUNCATE TABLE table(s) [ CASCADE ]
```

#### Managing Tuples

```sql
-- Insert into a table
INSERT INTO table (Attrs) Values Tuple(s)

-- Delete from a table
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition

-- Update a table
UPDATE table SET AttrValueChanges WHERE condition
```

where

- `Attrs` = `(attr1, attr2, ..., attrn)`
- `Tuple` = `(val1, val2, ..., valn)`
- `AttrValueChanges` is a comma seperated list of `attrname = expression`

#### Types

```sql
-- Define own constrained type
CREATE DOMAIN Name AS Type CHECK (Constraint)

-- Define tuple type
CREATE TYPE Name AS (AttrName AttrType, ...)

-- Define enumerated type
CREATE TYPE Name AS ENUM ('Label', ...)
```

#### String Comparison

- `a < b` compares strings `a` and `b` using dictionary order
- `a LIKE pattern` matches string `a` to pattern
- `%` matches anything
- `_` matches a single char

PostgreSQL provides regexp-based pattern matching.

```sql
-- ~ and !
Attr ~ 'RegExp'     -- Matches 'RegExp'
Attr !~ 'RegExp'    -- Doesn't match 'RegExp'

-- ~* and !~*
Attr ~* 'RegExp'    -- Matches 'RegExp' case-insensitive
Attr !~* 'RegExp'   -- Doesn't match 'RegExp' case-insensitive
```

#### String Manipulation

```sql
-- Concatenate a and b
a || b

-- Lowercase a
lower(a)

-- Extract substring from a
substring(a, start, count)
```

#### Queries

An SQL query consists of a sequence of clauses:

```sql
SELECT   projectionList
FROM     relations/joins
WHERE    condition
GROUP BY groupingAttributes
HAVING   groupCondition
```

The `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are optional.

#### Views

A view associates a name with a query. Each time the view is invoked (in a `FROM` clause) the query is evaluated, yielding a set of tuples. The set of tuples is used as the value of the view.

A view can be treated as a 'virtual table' and are useful for packaging a complex query to use in other queries.

```sql
CREATE VIEW viewName [(attributes)] AS Query
```

## Programming With SQL

### PostgreSQL Stored Procedures

The PostgreSQL syntax for defining stored *functions*:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  funcName(arg1, arg2, ...) RETURNS retType
AS $$
String containing function definition
$$ LANGUAGE funcDefLanguage;
```

where

- `arg1, arg2, ...` consists of `name type`
- `$$ ... $$` are just a type of string quote
- `LANGUAGE` is a function definition language (e.g. Python, SQL, PLpgSQL)

#### PLpgSQL

The PLpgSQL interpreter

- Executes procedural code and manages variables
- Calls the PostgreSQL engine to evaluate SQL statements

#### Function Return Types

A PostgreSQL function can return a value which is

- `void`
- An atomic data type (`integer`, `text`, ...)
- A tuple
- A set of atomic values (`setof integer`, ...)
- A set of tuples (`setof Employee` where `Employee` is a tuple)

A function returning a set of values is similar to a view.

### SQL Functions

PostgreSQL allows functions to be defined in SQL:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE
  funcName(arg1type, arg2type, ...)
  RETURNS retType
AS $$
  SQL statements
$$ LANGUAGE sql;
```

Within the function, arguments are accessed as `$1, $2, ...` corresponding to their position in the function definition.

A parameterless function behaves similar to a view.

### PLpgSQL

PLpgSQL stands for **P**rocedural **L**anguage extensions to **P**ost**g**re**SQL**. It is a PostgreSQL-specific language integrating features of procedural programming and SQL programming.

It provides a means for extending DBMS functionality, specifically it

- Implements constraint checking (triggered functions)
- Has complex query evaluation (e.g. recursive)
- Has complex computation of column values
- Has detailed control of displayed results

PLpgSQL functions are created (and inserted into db) via:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE
  funcName(param1, param2, ...)
  RETURNS retType 
AS $$
DECLARE
   variable declarations
BEGIN
   code for function
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The entire function body is stored as a single SQL string.

PLpgSQL 

- Doesn't provide any I/O facilities
- Does not syntxa check functions when loaded into DB
- Has unhelpful error messages
- Stores functions as strings

#### Data Types

PLpgSQL constants and variables can be defined using

- Standard SQL data types (`CHAR`, `DATE`, `NUMBER`, ...)
- User defined PostgreSQL data types (e.g. `Point`)
- A special structured record type (`RECORD`)
- Table-row types (e.g. `Branches%ROWTYPE`)
- Types of existing variables (e.g. `Branches.location%TYPE`)

There is also a `CURSOR` type for interacting with SQL.

Variables can also be defined in terms of

- The type of an existing variable or table column
- The type of an existing table row (implict `RECORD` type)

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Assignment
var := exp
SELECT exp INTO var

-- Selection
IF C1 THEN S1
ELSIF C2 THEN S2 ...
ELSE S END IF

-- Iteration
LOOP S END LOOP
WHILE C LOOP S END LOOP
FOR rec_var IN Query LOOP ...
FOR int_var IN lo..hi LOOP ...
```

##### `SELECT ... INTO`

Can capture query results via

```sql
SELECT Exp1, Exp2, ..., ExpN
INTO   Var1, Var2, ..., VarN
FROM   TableList
WHERE  Condition ...
```

where the query is executed as usual, a projection list is returned as usual and each `ExpI` is assigned corresponding to each `VarI`.

### Aggregates

Aggregates reduce a collection of values into a single result.

The action of an aggregate function can be viewed as

```c
State = initial state for each item V {
  // update State to include V
  State = updateState(State, V)
}
return makeFinal(State)
```

#### PostgreSQL User Defined Aggregates

The SQL standard does not specify user-defined aggregates, but PostgreSQL does provides a mechanism for defining them.

To define a new aggregate, we need to supply

- A `BaseType`, the type of input values
- A `StateType`, the type of intermediate states
- A state mapping function `sfunc(state, value) -> newState`
- Optionally, an initial state value (defaults to `NULL`)
- Optionally, a final function `ffunc(state) -> result`

Aggregates are created using the `CREATE AGGREGATE` statement:

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE AggName(BaseType) (
  sfunc = UpdateStateFunction, 
  stype = StateType,
  initcond = InitialValue,
  finalfunc = MakeFinalFunction,
  sortop = OrderingOperator
);
```

where

- `initcond` (with type `StateType`) is optional; defaults to `NULL`
- `finalfunc` is optional; defaults to identity function
- `sortop` is optional; needed for min/max-type aggregates

##### User Defined `count()`

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE myCount(anyelement) (
  stype = int, 
  initcond = 0, 
  sfunc = oneMore
);

CREATE FUNCTION oneMore(sum int, x anyelement) RETURNS int
AS $$
  BEGIN
    RETURN sum + 1; 
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;
```

### Constraints

Column and table constraints ensure validity of one table. Referential integrity constraints ensure connections between tables are valid. However, specifying validity of an entire database often requires constraints involving multiple tables.

#### Assertions

Assertions are schema-level constraints. They

- Typically involving multiple tables
- Express a condition that must hold at all times
- Need to be checked on each change to relevant tables
- Reject changes if changes would cause check to fail

To create an assertion, we use the syntax `CREATE ASSERTION name CHECK (condition)`, where the condition is expressed as "there are no violations in the database".

For example, to ensure that the number of students in any university course must be < 10000, an assertion can be defined as follows

```sql
CREATE ASSERTION ClassSizeConstraint CHECK (
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT c.id FROM Courses c, CourseEnrolments e 
    WHERE c.id = e.course
    GROUP BY c.id
    HAVING count(e.student) > 9999
  )
)
```

On each update, it is expensive to determine which assertions need to be checked and to run the queries which check the assertions. Most RDBMSs do not implement general assertions, but rather provide *triggers*

#### Triggers

Triggers are procedures stored in the database that are activated in response to database events.

Triggers provide event-condition-action (ECA) programming where

- An *event* activates the trigger
- A *condition* is checked
- If the condition holds, an *action* is executed

To define a trigger, we use the syntax

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TriggerName 
{AFTER|BEFORE} Event1 [ OR Event2 ... ] 
[ FOR EACH ROW ]
ON TableName
[ WHEN ( Condition ) ]
Block of Procedural/SQL Code;
```

Possible `Event`s are `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`.

##### Semantics

Triggers can be activated `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the event.

If activated `BEFORE`

- A value `NEW` contains the "proposed" value of changed tuple
- Modifying `NEW` causes a different value to be placed in the database

If activated `AFTER`

- `NEW` contains the current value of the changed tuple
- A value `OLD` contains the previous value of the changed tuple
- Constraint checking *has* been done for `NEW`

## Catalogs

A standard `information_schema` exists for describing metadata about the database.

### PostgreSQL Catalog

PostgreSQL implemented it's own catalogs long before the standard `information_schema` was developed.

The PostgreSQL catalog is accessible via `pg_XXX` tables/views, for example

- `pg_roles(oid, rolname, rolsuper, ...)`
- `pg_database(oid, datname, datdba, ..., datacl)`
- `pg_attribute(oid, attrrelid, attname, atttypid, ...)`

PostgreSQL also has a standard catalog also available, via `information_schema`.

## Programming With Databases

A common database access pattern used in programming languages is seen below.

```python
db = connect_to_dbms(DBname, User/Password)

query = build_SQL('SQLStatementTemplate', values)

results = execute_query(db, query)

while more_tuples_in(results):
  tuple = fetch_row_from(results)
  # do something with values in tuple
```

### Python & Psycopg2

Psycopg2 is a Python module that provides

- A method to connect to PostgreSQL databases
- A collection of DB-related exceptions
- A collection of type and object constructors

A standard Psycopg2 program is seen below.

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(DB_connection_string)

cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('SQLStatementTemplate', values)

conn.close()
```

Psycopg2 has various useful methods

- `conn.commit()`
  - Commit changes made to the database since last `commit()`
- `cur.mogrify('SQLStatementTemplate', values)`
  - Returns the SQL statement as a string with values inserted
- `cur.fetchall()`
  - Returns a list of tuples
- `cur.fetchone()`
  - Returns a single tuple
- `cur.fetchmany(nTuples)`
  - Returns `nTuples` amount of tuples

## Relational Design Theory

A good relational database design

- Must capture all necessary attributes/associations
- Do this with minimal amount of stored information

### Relational Design & Redundancy

In database design, redundancy is generally a bad thing as it causes problems maintaining consistency after updates.

### Functional Dependencies

A relation instance $r(R)$ satisfies a dependency $X \to Y$ if for any $t, u \in r, t[X] = u[X] \implies t[Y] = u[Y]$.

In other words, if two tuples in $R$ agree in their values for the set of attributes $X$, then they must also agree in their values for the set of attributes $Y$. In this case, we say that $Y$ is *functionally dependent* on $X$.

Attribute sets $X$ and $Y$ may overlap, and it is trivially true that $X \to X$.

#### Inference Rules

Armstrong's rules are general rules of inference on functional dependencies.

- **Reflexivity**: $X \to X$
- **Augmentation**: $X \to Y \implies XZ \to YZ$
- **Transitivity**: $X \to Y, Y \to Z \implies X \to Z$

Other useful rules exist too.

- **Additivity**: $X \to Y, X \to Z \implies X \to YZ$
- **Projectivity**: $X \to YZ \implies X \to Y, Y \to Z$
- **Pseudotransitivity**: $X \to Y, YZ \to W \implies XZ \to W$

#### Closure

Given a set $F$ of functional dependencies, how many new functional dependencies can we derive? For a finite set of attributes, there must be a finite set of derivable functional dependencies.

The largest collection of dependencies that can be derived from $F$ is called the *closure* of $F$ and is denoted $F^+$.

### Normalisation

Normalisation aims to

- Be able to characterise the level of redundancy in a relational schema
- Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas to remove redundancy

#### Normal Forms

Normalisation theory defines six normal forms

- First, Second, Third Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
- Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

where 1NF allows the most redundancy and 5NF allows the least redundancy.

Normalisation aims to puts a schema into xNF by ensuring that all relations in the schema are in xNF.

#### Relation Decomposition

The standard transformation technique to remove redundancy is to *decompose* a relation $R$ into relations $S$ and $T$.

We accomplish decomposition by

- Selecting (overlapping) subsets of attributes
- Forming new relations based on attribute subsets

Properties include $R = S \cup T$, $S \cap T = \emptyset$ and $r(R) = s(S) \bowtie t(T)$.

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

A relation schema $R$ is in BCNF with reference to a set $F$ of functional dependencies iff for all functional dependencies $X \to Y \in F^+$

- Either $X \to Y$ is trivial (i.e. $Y \subset X$)
- Or $X$ is a superkey (i.e. non-strict superset of attributes in key)

A database schema is in BCNF if all of its relation schemas are in BCNF.

The following algorithm converts an arbitrary schema to BCNF.

```python
# Inputs: schema R, set F of functional dependencies 
# Output: set Res of BCNF schemas

Res = {R};

while any schema S in Res is not in BCNF:
  choose any fd X -> Y on S that violates BCNF
  Res = (Res-S) union (S-Y) union XY
```

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A relation schema $R$ is in 3NF with reference to a set $F$ of functional dependencies iff for all functional dependencies $X \to Y \in F^+$

- Either $X \to Y$ is trivial (i.e. $Y \subset X$)
- Or $X$ is a superkey
- Or $Y$ is a single attribute from a key

A database schema is in 3NF if all relation schemas are in 3NF.

If we transform a schema into 3NF, we are guaranteed

- Lossless join decomposition
- The new schema preserves all of the functional dependencies from the original schema

The following algorithm converts an arbitrary schema to 3NF.

```python
# Inputs: schema R, set F of fds
# Output: set R_i of 3NF schemas

let F_c be a minimal cover for F

Res = {} 

for each fd X -> Y in F_c:
  if no schema S in Res contains XY:
    Res = Res union XY

if no schema S in Res contains a candidate key for R:
  K = any candidate key for R
  Res = Res union K
```

## Relational Algebra

Relational algebra can be viewed as a

- Mathematical system for manipulating relations
- Data manipulation language for the relational model

It consists of

- *Operands*: relations, or variables representing relations
- *Operators* that map relations to relations
- Rules for combining operands/operators into expressions
- Rules for evaluating such expressions

The core relational algebra operations are

- *Selection*: choosing a subset of tuples/rows
- *Projection*: choosing a subset of attributes/columns
- *Product, Join*: combining relations
- *Union, Intersection, Difference*: combining relations
- *Rename*: change names of relations/attributes

### Notation

| Operation  | Standard Notation            | Our Notation                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Selection  | $\sigma_{expr}(Rel)$         | $Sel\[expr\](Rel)$             |
| Projection | $\pi_{A, B, B}(Rel)$         | $Proj\[A, B, C\](Rel)$         |
| Join       | $Rel_1 \bowtie_{expr} Rel_2$ | $Rel_1 \ Join[expr] \ Rel_2$ |
| Rename     | $\rho_{schema} Rel$          | $Rename\[schema\](Rel)$        |

We define the semantics of RA operations using

- "Conditional set" expressions, e.g. $\\{ X \mid condition \ on \ X \\}$
- Tuple notations
  - $t[A, B]$ extracts attributes $A$ and $B$ from tuple $t$
  - $(x, y, z)$ enumerated tuples, specify attribute values
- Quantifiers, set operations, boolean operators

### Selection

Selection $Sel\[C\](r)$ returns a subset of the tuples in a relation $r(R)$ that satisfy a specified condition $C$.

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t in relation r:
  if C(t):
    result = result + {t}
```

### Projection

Projection $Proj\[X\](r)$ returns a set of tuples containing a subset of the attributes in the original relation, where $X$ specifies a subset of the attributes of $R$.

In pseudocode

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t in relation r:
  result = result + {t[X]}
```

### Product

Product $r \times s$ combines information from two relations pairwise on tuples.

In pseudocode

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t1 in relation r:
  for each tuple t2 in relation s:
    result = result + {(t1:t2)}
```

### Natural Join

Natural join $r \ Join \ s$ is a specialised product. It contains only pairs that match on common attributes with one of each pair of common attributes eliminated.

In pseusocode

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t1 in relation r:
  for each tuple t2 in relation s:
    if matches(t1, t2):
      result = result + {combine(t1, t2)}
```

### Theta Join

Theta join $r \ Join[C] \ s$ is a specialised product containing only pairs that match on a supplied condition $C$.

### Rename

Rename provides "schema mapping". If expression $E$ returns a relation $R(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n)$ then $Rename\[S(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n)\](E)$ gives a relation called $S$ containing the same set of tuples as $E$ but with the name of each attribute changed from $A_i$ to $A_b$.

### Union

Union $r_1 \cup r_2$ combines two compatible relations into a single relation via set union of sets of tuples.

In pseudocode

```python
result = r1

for each tuple t in relation r2:
  result = result + {t}
```

### Intersection

Intersection $r_1 \cap r_2$ combines two compatible relations into a single relation via set intersection of sets of tuples.

In pseudocode

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t in relation r1:
  if t in r2:
    result = result + {t}
```

### Difference

Difference $r_1 - r_2$ finds the set of tuples that exist in one relation but do not occur in a second compatible relation.

In pseudocode

```python
result = {}

for each tuple t in relation r1:
  if t not in r2:
    result = result + {t}
```

### Division

Division $r \ Div \ s$ considers each subset of tuples in a relation $R$ that match on $t[R - S]$ for a relation $S$. For this subset of tuples, it takes the $t[S]$ values from each, and if this covers all tuples in $S$, then it includes $t[R - S]$ in the result.

We have $r \ Div \ s = \\{ t : t \in r[R - S] \land satisfy \\}$ where $satisfy = \forall t_s \in S : \exists t_r \in R : t_r[S] = t_s \land t_r[R - S] = t$.

## DBMS Architecture

### Query Evaluation

The cost of evaluating a SQL query is determined by

- The operations specified in the query execution plan
- The size of relations (database relations and temporary relations)
- Access mechanisms (indexing, hashing, sorting, join algorithms)
- Size/number of main memory buffers (and replacement strategy)

The analysis of costs involves estimating the size of intermediate results then, based on this, the cost of secondary storage accesses. Accessing data from disk is the dominant cost in query evaluation.

Relational algebra operations can use different algorithms:

- Sorting
  - External merge sort ($\mathcal{O}(N \log_B N)$ with $B$ memory buffers)
- Selection
  - Sequential scan ($\mathcal{O}(N)$)
  - Index based ($\mathcal{O}(\log_N)$ with b-trees)
  - Hash based ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ best case, but only works with equality tests)
- Join
  - Nested loop join ($\mathcal{O}(NM)$, reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N + M)$ with buffering)
  - Sort merge join ($\mathcal{O}(N \log_N + M \log_M)$)
  - Hash join ($\mathcal{O}(N + MN / B)$ with $B$ memory buffers)

### Query Optimisation

A DBMS query optimiser works as follows:

```python
# Input: relational algebra expression
# Output: execution plan (sequence of RA ops)

bestCost = INF
bestPlan = None 

while more possible plans:
  plan = produce a new evaluation plan 
  cost = estimated_cost(plan)
  if cost < bestCost:
    bestCost = cost
    bestPlan = plan

return bestPlan
```

Typically, there are very many possible plans, but smarter optimisers generate a subset of possible plans.

### Indexes

Indexes provide efficient content-based access to tuples. Indexes can be built on any combination of attributes.

To define an index

```sql
CREATE INDEX name ON table (attr1, attr2, ...)
```

### PostgreSQL Query Tuning

PostgreSQL provides the `EXPLAIN` statement to give a representation of the query execution plan with information that may help to tune query performance.

To explain an query

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE Query
```

Without `ANALYZE`, `EXPLAIN` shows a plan with estimated costs, with `ANALYZE`, `EXPLAIN` executes the query and prints the real costs.

## Transactions

A transaction is an atomic "unit of work" in an application which may require multiple database changes. Transactions happen in a multi-user, unreliable environment.

To maintain integrity of data, transactions must be

- *Atomic*: either fully completed or totaly rolled-back
- *Consistent*: map database between consistent states
- *Isolated*: transactions do not interfere with each other
- *Durable*: persistent, restorable after system failures

A transaction must always terminate, either successfully (`COMMIT`) with all changes preserved, or unsuccessfully (`ABORT`) with the database unchanged.

To describe transaction effects, we consider

- `READ`: transfer data from disk to memory
- `WRITE`: transfer data from memory to disk
- `ABORT`: terminate transaction, unsuccessfully
- `COMMIT`: terminate transaction, successfully

normally abbreviated to `R(X)`, `W(X)`, `A`, `C`.

### Transaction Consistency

Transactions typically have intermediate states that are invalid. However, states *before* and *after* transactions must be valid.

A *schedule* defines a specific execution of one or more transactions, typically concurrent, with interleaved operations.

Abribtrary interleaving of operations causes anomalies, so that two consistency-preserving transactions produce a final state which is not consistent.

#### Serial Schedules

Given two transactions $T_1$ and $T_2$

```
T1: R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
T2: R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
```

there exist two *serial* executions

```
T1: R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
T2:                     R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
```

and

```
T1:                     R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
T2: R(X) W(X) R(Y) W(Y)
```

Serial execution guarantees a consistent final state if the initial state of the database is consistent and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are consistency-preserving.

#### Concurrent Schedules

Concurrent schedules interleave transaction operations. Some concurrent schedules ensure consistency, and some cause anomalies.

### Serialisability

A serialisable schedule is a concurrent schedule for $T_1 \dots T_n$ with a final state $S$. $S$ is also a final state of one of the possible serial schedules for $T_1 \dots T_N$.

There are two common formulations of serialisability

- *Conflict serialisability*: read/write operations occur in the right order
- *View serialisability*: read operations see the correct version of data

#### Conflict Serialisability

Two transactions have a potential conflict if they perform operations on the same data item and at least one of the operations is a write operation. In such cases, the order of operations affects the result. If there is no conflict, we can swap order without affecting the result.

If we can transform a schedule by swapping the order of non-conflicting operations such that the result is a serial schedule then we can say that the schedule is *conflict serialisable*.

To check for conflict serialisability we need to show that ordering in concurrent schedule cannot be achieved in any serial schedule. This can be achieved by building a *precedence graph* where

- Nodes represent transactions
- Edges represent the order of an action on shared data
- An edge from $T_1$ to $T_2$ means $T_1$ acts on $X$ before $T_2$
- Cycles incicate that the schedule is **not** conflict serialisable

#### View Serialisability

*View serialisability* is an alternative formulation of serialisability that is less strict than conflict serialisability.

Two schedules $S$ and $S^\prime$ on $T_1 \dots T_n$ are view equivalent iff for each shared data item $X$

- If, in $S$, $T_j$ reads the initial value of $X$, then, in $S^\prime$, $T_j$ also reads the initial value of $X$
- If, in $S$, $T_j$ reads $X$ written by $T_k$, then, in $S^\prime$, $T_j$ also reads the value of $X$ written by $T_k$ in $S^\prime$
- If, in $S$, $T_j$ performs the final write of $X$, then, in $S^\prime$, $T_j$ also performs the final write of $X$

To check serialisability of $S$, find a serial schedule that is view equivalent to $S$ from among the $n!$ possible serial schedules.

## Concurrency Control

Serialisability tests are useful theoretically, but don't provide a mechanism for organising schedules.

Approaches to ensuring ACID transactions:

- Lock based
  - Synchronise transaction execution via locks on some portion of the database
- Version based
  - Allow multiple consistent versions of the data to exist, and allow each transaction exclusive access to one version
- Timestamp based
  - Organise transaction execution in advance by assigning timestamps to operations
- Validation based
  - Exploit typical execution-sequence properties of transactions to determine safety dynamically

### Lock Based Concurrency Control

Locak based concurrency control involves synchronising access to shared data items via the following rules

- Before reading $X$, get a shared (read) lock on $X$
- Before writing $X$, get a exclusive (write) lock on $X$
- An attempt to get a shared lock on $X$ is blocked if another transaction already has an exclusive lock on $X$
- An attempt to get an exclusive lock on $X$ is blocked if another transaction has any kind of lock on $X$

Overall, locking reduces concurrency which leads to lower throughput. Different granularity levels of locking (i.e. field, row, table, whole database) can also impact performance.

### Version Based Concurrency Control

Version based concurrency control provides multiple (consistent) versions of the database and gives each transaction access to a version that maintains the serialisability of the transaction.

In version based concurrency control, writing never blocks reading and reading never blocks writing.
