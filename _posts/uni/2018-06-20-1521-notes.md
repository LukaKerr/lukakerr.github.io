## Week 1

### Bit Manipulation

**Bitwise Operators**

- `&`
  - Bitwise AND
  - `10101010 & 11110000` = `10100000`
- `|`
  - Bitwise OR
  - `10101010 | 11110000` = `11111010`
- `^`
  - Bitwise XOR
  - `10101010 ^ 11110000` = `01011010`
- `~`
  - Bitwise NEG (flips the bits)
  - `~10101010` = `01010101`
- `<<`
  - Left shift
  - `11110010 << 2` = `11001000`
- `>>`
  - Right shift
  - `11110010 >> 2` = `00111100`



### Memory

**Regions**

- Code
  - Contains machine code for a program
  - Once initialised, doesn't change
- Data
  - Contains global variables and constants
  - Once initialised, doesnt change
- Heap
  - Contains dynamicaly allocated data created by `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`
  - Is able to increase (`malloc()`) and decrease (`free()`) throughout the program lifecycle
- Stack
  - Contains local variables that get destroyed once they go out of scope
  - Each function has a stack frame created when the function is called, and destroyed when the function returns



**Physical Memory**

- Indexed array of bytes
- Indexes are 'memory addresses', or pointers
- Two properties
  - Volatile - data lost when powered off
  - Non-volatile - data remains when powered off
- Can be *big-endian* or *little-endian*



## Week 2

### Data Representation

- Characters

  - ASCII (7-bit values), UTF-8 (8-bit values)

  - UTF-8 uses a variable length encoding as follows

    | #bytes | #bits | Byte 1    | Byte 2   | Byte 3   | Byte 4   |
    | ------ | ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
    | 1      | 7     | 0xxxxxxxx | -        | -        | -        |
    | 2      | 11    | 110xxxxx  | 10xxxxxx | -        | -        |
    | 3      | 16    | 1110xxxx  | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx | -        |
    | 4      | 21    | 11110xxx  | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx |

  - For example, UTF-8 to binary of `U+1D536`

    ```c
    0x1D536 = 0001 1101 0101 0011 0110    // there are 17 significant bits, use 4 byte encoding
    = 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
    = 11110000 10011101 10010100 10110110
    ```

- Integers

  - Can represent as a signed decimal (0..9), unsigned hexadecimal (0..F) or a signed octal (0..7)
  - `int` - can store values from $-2^{31} ... 2^{31}-1$
    - Can represent negative values using
      - *signed magnitude* - first bit is sign, rest are magnitude

      - *ones complement* - inverting all bits in a number (keeping the original sign)

      - *twos complement* - inverting all bits in a number and adding 1 (keeping the original sign)

        - For example, converting to twos complement

          ```c
          111010100                  // sign is 1, so negative result
          000101011                  // flip all the bits
          000101011 + 1 = 000101100  // add the value 1
          = -(44)                    // result is negative 44
          ```

  - `unsigned int` - can store values from $0...2^{32} - 1$

- Pointers

  - Size of pointers is the same for all data types
  - For any pointer `T *p`, `p++` increases p by `sizeof(T)`

- Floats

  - Two types
    - `float` - typically 32 bits
    - `double` - typically 64 bits

  - IEEE 754 standard

    - Stored with 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponential and 23 bits for the fraction

    - Converting from binary to decimal

      ```
      0 10000010 01000000000000000000000

      sign = 0 (positive)
      exp = 10000010 = (130 - 127 = 3)
      frac = 01000000000000000000000 = 2^(-2)

      = +1.25 x 2^3
      = 10
      ```

    - Converting from decimal to binary

      ```
      150.75

      150 = 10010110
      .75 = 11

      = 10010110.11
      = 1.001011011 x 2^7

      sign = 0 (positive)
      exp = 10000110 (127 + 7 = 134)
      frac = 00101101100000000000000 (001011011 + remaining digits)

      = 0 10000110 00101101100000000000000
      ```

- Arrays

  - Have a type and size
  - Laid out adjacent in memory

- Structs

  - Have a name and a type

  - Padding may be needed between elements in struct

  - Can have *bit wise structs*

  ```c
  struct _object { // comprised of two 32-bit integers
    unsigned int  red    : 5,  // 5 bits for red
                  blue   : 5,  // 5 bits for blue
                  green  : 5,  // 5 bits for green
                  pad    : 1,  // 1 bit to pad to short
                  ident  : 16; // 16 bits for object ID
    unsigned int  height : 6,  // 6 bits for object height
                  width  : 6,  // 6 bits for object width
                  xcoord : 9,  // 9 bits for x-coordinate
                  ycoord : 9;  // 9 bits for y-coordinate
  };

  struct _object oval;
  ...
  oval.red = 4; oval.blue = 31; oval.green = 15;
  oval.height = 5; oval.width = 15;
  ```

- Unions

  - Multiple interpretations for a single piece of memory
  - Size of union is the size of the largest element of the union

  ```c
  union Tag {
    Type1  Member1;
    Type2  Member2;
    Type3  Member3;
    ...
  } uvar;
  ```

- Enums

  - A set of distinct named values

  ```c
  typedef enum { RED, YELLOW, BLUE } PrimaryColours;
  ```



## Week 3

### Instruction Set Architectures

- A typical modern CPU has
  - A set of data registers
  - A set of control registers
  - An arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
  - Access to RAM
  - A set of simple instructions
- Two broad families of instruction set architectures
  - RISC - reduced instruction set computer
  - CICS - complex instruction set computer



**Fetch Execute Cycle**

All CPUs have program execution logic like:

```c
while (1) {
  instruction = memory[PC]
  PC++  // Program Counter move to next instruction
  if (instruction == HALT)
    break
  else
    execute(instruction)
}
```



## Week 4

### MIPS

- A simple architecture
- Has:
  - 32 x 32-bit general purpose registers
  - 16 x 64-bit double precision registers
  - Program Counter is a 32 bit register
  - HI and LO for storing results of multiplication and division



**Memory Addressing**

- Memory addresses can be given by a symolic name (label) or indirectly via a register

```assembly
    .data
vec: .space   16      # int vec[4];
    .text             # 16 bytes of storage
    .globl  main
main:
    la  $t0, vec      # reg[t0] = &vec
    li  $t1, 5        # reg[t1] = 5
    sw  $t1, ($t0)    # vec[0] = reg[t1]
    li  $t1, 13       # reg[t1] = 13
    sw  $t1, 4($t0)   # vec[1] = reg[t1]
    li  $t1, -7       # reg[t1] = -7
    sw  $t1, 8($t0)   # vec[2] = reg[t1]
    li  $t2, 12       # reg[t2] = 12
    li  $t1, 42       # reg[t1] = 42
    sw  $t1, vec($t2) # vec[3] = reg[t1]
```



**SPIM**

- Spim is an *emulator* for the MIPS instruction set

- It reads .s files, converts them to machine code and loads them into memory

- Provides extra instructions such as `move`

- Provides debugging capabilities and mechanisms to interact with the operating system (i.e. syscalls)

  | Service      | Code | Arguments                   | Result            |
  | ------------ | ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | print_int    | 1    | `$a0` = integer             |                   |
  | print_float  | 2    | `$f12` = float              |                   |
  | print_double | 3    | `$f12` = double             |                   |
  | print_string | 4    | `$a0` = char *              |                   |
  | read_int     | 5    |                             | integer in \$v0   |
  | read_float   | 6    |                             | float in \$f0     |
  | read_double  | 7    |                             | double in \$f0    |
  | read_string  | 8    | `$a0` = buffer, `$a1` = length | string in buffer |



**Functions**

- When a function is called
  - The arguments are evaluated and setup for the function (`$a0`, `$a1`)
  - Control is transferred to the code for the function (`jal`)
  - Local variables are created (`$s0`, `$s1`)
  - The function code is executed
  - The return value is setup (`$v0`)
  - Control transfers back to where the function was called from (`jr $ra`)
  - The caller receives the return value

- Data associated with the function call is placed on the MIPS stack

- Each function allocates a section of the stack (the stack frame)

- Example function call and stack frame setup:

  ```assembly
  func:
    # setup stack frame with registers $s0, $s1, $s2
    sw    $fp, -4($sp)
    sw    $ra, -8($sp)
    sw    $s0, -12($sp)
    sw    $s1, -16($sp)
    sw    $s2, -20($sp)
    la    $fp, -4($sp)
    add   $sp, $sp, -20

    ...

  end:
    # return value, move $s1 into $v0
    move  $v0, $s1

    # epilogue
    lw    $s2, -16($fp)
    lw    $s1, -12($fp)
    lw    $s0, -8($fp)
    lw    $ra, -4($fp)
    la    $sp, 4($fp)
    lw    $fp, ($fp)
    jr    $ra
  ```


**2D Arrays**

- Can be represented as one large chunk of memory (a), or as pointers to rows in memory (b)

- To access an element at `int arr[row][col]` we can use the formula $((row \times rowsize) + col) \times sizeof(int)$

- For strategy (a) we can implement it as follows:

  ```assembly
    li  $s0, 0             # sum = 0
    li  $s1, 6             # s1 = #rows
    li  $s2, 0             # row = 0
    li  $s3, 5             # s3 = #cols
    li  $s4, 0             # col = 0 // redundant
    li  $s5, 4             # intsize = sizeof(int)
    mul $s6, $s3, $s5      # rowsize = #cols*intsize
  loop1:
    beq  $s2, $s1, end1    # if (row >= 6) break
    li   $s4, 0            # col = 0
  loop2:
    beq  $s4, $s3, end2    # if (col >= 5) break
    mul  $t0, $s2, $s6     # t0 = row*rowsize
    mul  $t1, $s4, $s5     # t1 = col*intsize
    add  $t0, $t0, $t1     # offset = t0+t1
    lw   $t0, matrix($t0)  # t0 = *(matrix+offset)
    add  $s0, $s0, $t0     # sum += t0
    addi $s4, $s4, 1       # col++
    j    loop2
  end2:
    addi $s2, $s2, 1       # row++
    j    loop1
  end1:
  ```



**Structs**

- Structs in MIPS are just blocks of memory, where each member can be accessed using the appropriate offset

  ```assembly
  stu1: .space 56       # Student stu1;
  stu2: .space 56       # Student stu2;
  # stu is $s1          # Student *stu;

  li  $t0  5012345
  sw  $t0, stu1+0       # stu1.id = 5012345;
  li  $t0, 3778
  sw  $t0, stu1+44      # stu1.program = 3778;

  la  $s1, stu2         # stu = &stu2;
  li  $t0, 3707
  sw  $t0, 44($s1)      # stu->program = 3707;
  li  $t0, 5034567
  sw  $t0, 0($s1)       # stu->id = 5034567;
  ```



## Week 5

### Computer System Architecture

**Operating Systems**

- Provide an abstraction layer on top of hardware
- Characteristics:
  - Have privileged access to the raw machine
  - Manage use of machine resources (CPU, disk, memory)
  - Provide a uniform interface to access machine level operations
  - Arrange for controlled execution of user programs
  - Provide multi-tasking and parallelism
- Abstractions provided:
  - Uses, access rights, file system, input/output, processes, communication and networking
- Flavours:
  - Batch (Eniac, early IBM)
    - Computational jobs run one at a time via a queue
  - Multi-user (Unix, Linux OSX, Windows)
    - Multiple jobs run in parallel
  - Embedded
    - Smallish, cut-down systems embedded in a device
  - Real-time
    - Specialised OS with time guarantees on job completion
- Evolution of Unix
  - 1970's - Bell Labs delevoped a small OS core written mostly in high level languages and having a small set of simple tools
  - 1980's to present - Unix and variants ported to wide variety of architectures and developments in hardware/sortware led to more OS services (databases, networking, GUIs)
- CPUs typically run in either privileged mode (full access to all machine operations and memory) or non-privileged mode (limited set of operations and access to part of memory).



**System Calls**

- Used primarily for input/output (`printf()`), memory allocation (`malloc()`), file management (`read()`, `open()`), device management (`ioctl()`), information maintenance (`settimeofday()`) and communication (`pipe()`, `connect()`)
- Successful system calls usually return 0, unsuccessful system falls usually return -1 or raise an error `errno`



### File Systems

- Provide a mechanism for managing stored data

- Unix file system:

  - Paths are absolute or relative
  - Metadata is stored in *inodes* which hold
    - Physical location on storage device of file data
    - File type and file size
    - Ownership, access permissions, timestamps

- Links

  - Hard links are when multiple directory entries reference the same inode
  - Symolic links refers to a file containing the path name of another file

- Various file system functions

  ```c
  // attemps to open an object at Path according to Flags (i.e. O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_APPEND...)
  int open(char *Path, int Flags);

  // attemps to release an open file descriptor
  int close(int FileDesc);

  // attempts to read Count bytes from FileDesc into Buffer
  ssize_t read(int FileDesc, void *Buffer, size_t Count);

  // attempts to write Count bytes from Buffer onto FileDesc
  ssize_t write(int FileDesc, void *Buffer, size_t Count);

  // stores metadata associated with FileName into StatBuf
  int stat(char *FileName, struct stat *StatBuf);

  // same as stat() but gets data via an open file descriptor
  int fstat(int FileDesc, struct stat *StatBuf);

  // same as stat() but doesn't follow symbolic links
  int lstat(char *FileName, struct stat *StatBuf);

  // create a new directory called PathName with mode Mode
  int mkdir(char *PathName, mode_t Mode);

  // attaches a file system Source to a Target (mount point) with a particular layout/driver FileSysType and with specific properties of the file system Flags
  int mount(char *Source, char *Target, char *FileSysType, unsigned long Flags, void *data);
  ```



## Week 6

### Memory Management

- In early days
  - One process at a time
  - The single process could use the entirety of the memory
  - Addresses within process code are absolute
- Nowadays
  - Multiple processes are loaded into memory at once
  - Addresses are relative to the other processes and their memory usage
  - When adding a new process, if there isn't a large enough free space we can split processes to create a larger space. The process address mapping table must be updated
- Process memory
  - Each 'chunk' of address space is called a *page*
  - All paegs are the same size $P$ (PageSize)
  - Process memory is spread across $ceiling(ProcSize/P)$ pages
  - Page $i$ has addresses $A$ in range $i \times P \le A \lt (i + 1) \times P$
- Address mapping table
  - Each process has an array of page entries
  - Each page entry contains start address of one chunk
  - Can compute index of relevant page entry by $A / P$
  - Can compute offset within page by $A \ \% \ P$



**Address Mapping**

To map from process address (virtual address) to physical address:

```c
typedef struct {char status, uint frameNo, ...} PageData;

PageData *AllPageTables[maxProc]; // one entry for each process

Address processToPhysical(pid, Vaddr) {
  PageData *PageTable = AllPageTables[pid];
  uint pageno = PageNumberFrom(Vaddr);
  uint offset = OffsetFrom(Vaddr);
  if (PageTable[pageno].status != Loaded) {
    // load page into free frame
    // set PageTable[pageno]
  }
  uint frame = PageTable[pageno].frameNo;
  return frame * P + offset;
}
```



**Virtual Memory**

- Divides process memory space into fixed sized pages
- On-demand loading of process pages into physical memory
- Pages/frames are usually 512B to 8KB in size
- Each frame holds one page of process address space
- Requesting a non-loaded page generates a *page fault*
  - To handle page faults, we can find a free (unused) page frame in memory and use that
  - When finding free page we can either **suspend** the requesting process until a page is free, or **replace** a currently loaded page based on some condition (possibly by when it was loaded)
- Page replacement
  - When a page is replaced
    - If it has been modified, save it to disk
    - Get its frame number and give it to the requestor
  - To decide which page to replace, we can use a measure of usefulness. This may be implemented using a priority queue. The page with the lowest usefulness is replaced
  - A useful heuristic is *LRU replacement* which refers to replacing a page that hasn't been used recently and may not be needed again
  - Other heuristics include *FIFO* and *clock sweep*



**Cache Memory**

- Small, fast and close to the CPU
- Holds parts of RAM that are heavily used
- Transfers data to and from RAM in cache blocks



**Memory Management Hardware**

- Specialised hardware (MMU) is provided to perform address translation efficiently
- Has a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) which is a lookup table containing virtual and physical address pairs



## Week 7

### Process Management

- A process is an instance of an executing program

- The OS manages multiple simultaneous processed using:

  - *Context* - a collection of information for one process
    - Static information - program code and data
    - Dynamic state - heap, stack, registers, program counter
    - OS-supplied state - environment variables, stdin, stdout
  - *Context switch*
    - Saves context for one process
    - Restores context for another process
  - *Process control block* - info about each process including:
    - Identifier - unique process ID (pid)
    - Status - running, ready, suspended or dead
    - State: registers, program counter
    - Privileges - owner, group
    - If suspended, the event being waited for
    - Memory management info - reference to page table
    - Accounting - CPU time used, amount of input/output done
    - Input/Output - open file descriptors

- Process info is split across process table entry and user structure

  - *Process table* - kernel data structure describing all processes
  - *User structure* - kernel data structure describing runtime state

- PIDs

  - Every process in Unix is allocated a unique, positive integer PID
  - PID 0 is the **scheduler**
  - PID 1 is **init**

- Zombie processes

  - A process which has exited but signal `SIGCHLD` not handed

- Orphan process

  - A process whose parent has exited

- Process related system calls

  ```c
  // creates new process by duplicating the calling process
  pid_t fork(void);

  // returns the PID of the current process
  pid_t getpid();

  // returns the parent PID of the current process
  pid_t getppid();

  // set the process group ID of specified process
  int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid);

  // returns the process group ID of specified process
  pid_t getpgid(pid_t pid);

  // pause current process until process pid changes state
  pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);

  // pauses until one of the child processes terminates
  pid_t wait(int *status);

  // send signal SigID to process ProcID
  int kill(pid_t ProcID, int SigID);

  // terminates current process, closes any open file descriptors
  void _exit(int status);

  // terminates current process, flushes stdio buffers, then behaves like _exit()
  void exit(int status);

  // generates SIGABRT signal
  void abort(void);

  // replaces current process by executing Path object, passes arrays of strings to new process
  int execve(char *Path, char *Argv[], char *Envp[]);
  ```



**Signals**

- Generated from a variety of sources (`kill()`, syscall, divide by zery, CTR-C)

- `man signal` for a list of signals

- Process can choose to ignore signals, or can terminate, terminate and dump core, stop, or continue

- Signal handlers are functions that are invoked in response to a signal

  - They know which signal was invoked
  - Carries out an appropriate action
  - Note for below: `typedef void (*SigHnd)(int);`

```c
// define how to handle a particular signal
// SigID is one of the OS-defined signals
// Handler could be SIG_IGN, or SIG_DFL or user defined
SigHnd signal(int SigID, SigHnd Handler);

// sigID is one of the OS-defined signals
// newAct defines how signal should be handled
// oldAct saves a copy of how signal was handled
int sigaction(int sigID, struct sigaction *newAct, struct sigaction *oldAct);
```



**Interrupts**

- Signals that cause normal process execution to be suspended
- An *interrupt handler* carries out tasks related to interrupt
- Control is then returned to the original process

**Exceptions**

- Unexpected but *not* unanticipated conditions which arise during computation

**Multi Tasking**

- Multiple processes are "active" at the same time

**Scheduling**

- Selecting which process should run next

- Processes are organised into priority queue(s) where "highest" priority process is always at head of queue

- Priority determined by multiple factors

  - System processes have higher priority
  - Longer running processes may have lower priority
  - Memory intensitve processes may have lower priority

- Abstract view of the OS scheduler

  ```
  function onTimerInterrupt() {
     save state of currently executing process
     newPID = dequeue(runnableProcesses)
     setup state of newPID
     - make process's Page Table active
     - load pages in working set
     - load process's registers
     transfer control to newPID
     - leave kernel mode
     - set PC to saved PC from process
  }
  ```



### Device Management

**I/O Devices**

- Hard Disks
  - Address specified by track and sector
  - Typical cost: 10ms seek + 5ms latency + 0.1ms transfer
- Solid State Disks
  - High capacity (GB), high cost, reading faster than writing

**Device Drivers**

- Code chunks to control an I/O device, often written in assembly

- Each type of device has its own unique access protocol

**Memory Mapped I/O**

- Operating system defines special memory address
- User programs perform I/O by getting/setting data into memory

**Devices On Unix**

- Devices can be accessed via the file system under `/dev`
- Two standard types of device files
  - Character devices - provide unbuffered direct access to hardware devices
  - Block devices - provide buffered access to hardware devices
- Devices can be manipulated by `open()`, `read()`, `write()` etc

**Buffered I/O**

- Devices are typically very slow compared to CPU speed
- Using a `read()` from a device for each byte is inefficient
- OS uses a collection of buffers to hold data from devices



## Week 8

### Networks

- A network is an interconnected collection of computers
- Internet communications are based on a 5 layer stack:
  - **Physical layer** - bits on wires or fibre optics or radio
  - **Link layer** - ethernet, MAC addressing, CSMA...
  - **Network layer** - routing protocols, IP
  - **Transport layer** - TCP/UDP
  - **Application layer** - DNS, HTTP, FTP, SMTP...
- *Network protocols* govern all communication activity on a network
  - Protocols are defined in all of the layers
  - Examples include PPP (link layer), IP (network layer), TCP (transport layer), HTTP (application layer)
- *Client-server architecture* is a common way of structuring network communication
  - The server is the data provided, that processes and waits for requests
  - The client is the data consumer that sends requests and receives responses
- *Addressing*
  - Servers must have a unique internet wide address
  - Includes an IP address and a port number, for example - 128.119.245.12:80
  - Some standard port numbers include 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
  - An *IP address* is a unique identifier for a host on a network, can be IPv4 (32 bit) or IPv6 (128 bit)
- *DNS*
  - The Doman Name System provides a mapping from name to IP address
  - Use the `host` command to view a servers IP address
  - Is decentralised and distributed
  - Two styles of name resolution
    - *Iterated query* - the client gets a response and send a request to a different server
    - *Recursive query* - the client contacts a server and the query propagates until the name is resolved



**Network Architecture In Depth**

- *Transport Layer*
  - Deals with data integrity (e.g. no packet loss), timing (delay/ping), throughput and security (tls)
  - Two main transport layer protocols - TCP (reliable, bytestream, `man tcp`) and UDP (unreliable, simple, fast, `man udp`)
- *Network Layer*
  - Provides a way for processes/hosts to communicate
  - Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer that provides host addressing, routing of packets, splitting and reassembly of large packets
  - Each host maintains a routing table and uses subnets to reduce table size
- *Link Layer*
  - Takes packets from the network layer and transmits them
  - Each host contains a network interface card (NIC)
  - Services provided by link layer include: flow control, error detection and error correction
  - An example is ethernet



## Week 9

### Concurrency

- *Parallelism* is when multiple comutations are executed simultaneously
- *Consurrency* is when multiple processes are running simultaneously
- One method for creating concurrent taks is using `fork()` which
  - Creates a new child process that executes concurrently with parent
  - Inherits some state from parent
  - Runs in its own address space
- Another method is threads which are
  - Independent of each other
  - Share parent process state
  - Share address space
- Effects of poorly controlled concurrency
  - **Nondeterminism** - same code on different runs produces different results
  - **Deadlock** - a group of processes end up waiting for each other
  - **Starvation** - one process keeps missing access to resource
- Concurrency control aims to provide correct sequencing of interactions between processes
  - Shared memory based - *semaphores*
    - Uses shared variable which is manipulated atomically
    - Blocks if access unavailabble, unblocks when available
  - Message passing bases - *send/receive*
    - Processes communicate by sending and receiving messages
    - Receiver can block waiting for message to arrive
    - Sender can block waiting for message to be received
- **Producer Consumer Problem**
  - The producer's job is to generate data, put it into a buffer, and start again. At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e., removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time
  - A problem arises when
    - The consumer checks and finds the buffer empty, and decides to pause
    - Before pausing the consumer gets timed out
    - The producer puts an item in the empty buffer
    - The producer signals the consumer
    - Because the consumer is not paused the signal is lost
    - The consumer is resumed after the time out and pauses
    - The producer resumes and adds items into the buffer until full, and then pauses
    - Each process is paused waiting for a signal from the other
  - The problem is called **deadlock**, and to fix it we use semaphores
- **File Locking**
  - Controls access to shared files
  - Uses `flock()`
  - `man 2 flock`
- **Pipes**
  - Provides buffered I/O between producer and consumer
  - Uses `pipe()`
  - Usually `fork()` called after pipe opened, so child and parent share pipe fd's and can communicate with each other
  - `man 2 pipe`
- **Message Queues**
  - Provides a mechanism for unrelated processes to pass information along a buffered channel shared by many processes
  - `man 7 mq_overview`
- **Sockets**
  - An IPC endpoint for communication
  - Commonly used for client server systems
    - Server creates a socket which binds to an address and listens for connections
    - Client creates a socket which connects to the socket and writes/reads from a socket
  - Uses a `struct sockaddr_in`
    - `sin_family` - domain (AF_UNIX or AF_INET)
    - `sin_port` - port number
    - `sin_addr` - struct containing host address
  - `man 2 socket`



**Functions Related to Concurrency**

```c
// creates a new thread with specified Attributes
// thread info stored in *Thread
// thread starts by executing Func() with Arg
int pthread_create(pthread_t *Thread, pthread_attr_t *Attr, void *(*Func)(void *), void *Arg);

// returns a pthread_t for current thread
pthread_t pthread_self(void);

// compares two thread IDs and returns 0 if the same, otherwise non-zero
int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);

// suspend execution until thread T terminates
// pthread_exit() value is placed in *value_ptr
// if T has already exited, does not wait
int pthread_join(pthread_t T, void **value_ptr);

// terminate execution of thread, and do some cleaning up
// stores a return value in *value_ptr
void pthread_exit(void *value_ptr);

// create a semaphore object, and set initial value
int sem_init(sem_t *Sem, int Shared, uint Value);

// try to decrement
// blocks if Sem == 0
int sem_wait(sem_t *Sem);

// increment the value of semaphore Sem
int sem_post(sem_t *Sem);

// free all memory associated with semaphore Sem
int sem_destroy(sem_t *Sem);

// controls access to shared files
int flock(int FileDesc, int Operation);

// open two file descriptors
// fd[0] is opened for reading, fd[1] is opened for writing
int pipe(int fd[2]);

// opens a process by creating a bidirectional pipe, forking, and invoking the shell Cmd
FILE *popen(char *Cmd, char *Mode);

// create a new message queue, or open existing one
mqd_t mq_open(char *Name, int Flags);

// finish accessing message queue MQ
int mq_close(mqd_t *MQ);

// adds message Msg to message queue MQ with a given priority Prio
int mq_send(mqd_t MQ, char *Msg, int Size, uint Prio);

// removes highest priority message from queue MQ
int mq_receive(mqd_t MQ, char *Msg, int Size, uint *Prio);

// creates a socket with a Domain, Type and Protocol
int socket(int Domain, int Type, int Protocol);

// associates an open socket with an address
int bind(int Sockfd, SockAddr *Addr, socklen_t AddrLen);

// wait for connections on socket Sockfd
// allow at most Backlog connections to be queued up
int listen(int Sockfd, int Backlog);

// Sockfd has been created, bound and is listening
int accept(int Sockfd, SockAddr *Addr, socklen_t *AddrLen);

// connects the socket Sockfd to address Addr
int connect(int Sockfd, SockAddr *Addr, socklen_t AddrLen);
```

Use `apropos <search_term>` to search for man pages

Use `man -K <search_term>` to brute force search man pages for a specific keyword

Use `bc (1)` To Convert Between Bases

```bash
# ibase is the input base, obase is the output base, <string> is the input string
echo 'obase=2; ibase=16; <string>' | bc

# converting hex to binary
echo 'obase=2; ibase=16; ABC123' | bc

# converting octal to binary
echo 'obase=2; ibase=8; 12345' |  bc

# converting hex to decimal - leave out the obase
echo 'ibase=16; ABC123' | bc
```
