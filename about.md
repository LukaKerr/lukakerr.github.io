I'm Luka, a software engineering student at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au) Sydney.

I enjoy programming with:

* Go
* Swift
* Haskell
* JavaScript/TypeScript

I also like writing in Markdown and LaTeX. Sometimes both together with [KaTeX](https://katex.org).

I have experience working as a software engineering intern at:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [ClickView](https://www.clickview.com.au)
- [Creative Licence Digital](https://www.creativelicence.com.au)

and am always open to new opportunities.

I also take surf photos. For more of my surf photography work, visit [www.lukakerrphoto.com](https://www.lukakerrphoto.com).
