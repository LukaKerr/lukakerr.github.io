I'm Luka, a software engineering student at UNSW Sydney.

I enjoy programming with:

* Swift
* JavaScript
* Ruby

I have experience working as a software engineering intern, and am always open to new opportunities.

I also take surf photos. For more of my surf photography work, visit [www.lukakerrphoto.com](https://www.lukakerrphoto.com).
